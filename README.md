"# Starter-JavaScript" 

The purpose if this repository is to share my studies while introducing Git' concept in my daily routine.

I will be updating it regularly.

If any of you could/want to ADD some information regarting any of my codes I'd be glad to learn from all of you.
I hope I can contribute myself in a near future.

Best Regards,
Giovani Cuenca,
